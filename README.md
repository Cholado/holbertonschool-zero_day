This project allows to learn the basics on how to use virtualbox alongside vagrant to set virtual machines and being able to install git in order to creaate a master and branches that can be used in other projects to do colaborative work in a enviroment equal from each other.

The project is useful because is a first step in the *italic* _creation of a enviroment_ free of errors involving different OS, its like setting the clean paper to start writting bigger projects.
